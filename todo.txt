 1)Creating a player
2)adding gravity to the player
    this can be achieved by adding the velocity to the player
    we will define a velocity property in the constructor
    but will need an update function to update it to change'
    velocity. As player will always move in y direction implies
    in update function we will be adding velocity to the current
    'y position. and this updation should be looped in order to
    update the value over and over again
    Animate function is used for this purpose

3) Player Movement-will be done using the arrows
    for this i used event listener to and map those to certain 
    transitions in the player poisition
    the movement is right is done with even listeners keyup and kneydown
    and with the animate loop if it is break it will break else keep moving

4) Platforms-we will be making a simple class for the platform 
where wew will be using the normal draw command and not the update

    Rather when the block falls on the platform it needs
    to sit on it and not fall through, it 
    this is done using collision detection system
    Rectangular collision system

5) Scroll- when player moves the scroll is also present.
    actually what we will do is that the movement of 
    the player is stopped and the background starts moving


6)Win Scenario - we will make it a standard length that
    if the player has travelled say 100m he wins
7) Added the image and also fixed the outline where the game will be played

8)Parallax effect- here everything added will act as a decorational
    object so this will have a seperate class of it
    Moving the generic Objects at a speed lesser than the speed of the movement of 
    the base

9)death pits-basically performed a check that if you have visited
bottom of the canvas.height in that case init() call which
reinitializes everything to default

10) Level creation- making more platforms and adding levels to the challenge and
also updating the win condition

11)fixing the back movement - such that if scrollOffset>0 then only move left
else don't move left also for the parallax effect to stabalize if scrollOffset===0

12) Sprite creation and using dekey tool (only free version is what i used and this
was the character available to me)
Basically creating the character and also adding animation to it

I will be having for each of a defined movement a single long animation
now using the draw context i was looping through the images to produce the
images in order to create a movement
I will be having a height and width parameter associated with the 
drawing context of the player
i have also added 4 more parameter after the this.image in raw contextto specify the 
cropped dimension of the photograph
and also added a parameter frame, which tells which frame we are
 currently of the image
 so as we have that cropping dimension as the frame keeps changing 
 over width dimesion of the crop starting point also changes by that amount and 
 gives us correspoding image and also we will be making it a modulo
 function so that it keeps on moving   
 added many properties like sprite and current sprite
 and when the key is pressed i have made it run 
 and if keyup then made it move
 As when i am noticing the player is running and the dimensions of the 
 running person is different in that case i have to change the dimensions of the 
 player
 also i had to add many parameters in order to maintain the correct
 dimensions of both the frames i am accounting for and also the 
 frames for stading is around 28 and frames for running animation is 
 around 60
 Similarly i added for the left movement too,
 but know the problem i faced was there was a delay between
 the key press and the game fps so for that i removed the toggle from
 there and then changed the animate function


 Now this is the basic blueprint reay 
 Additions for the project
 1)addition of audio
 2)addition of game completion and flag pole 
 3)enemy inclusion

 This will make the game complete for today , now i just need to 
 better the project with powerups, coin collection, and scoring system
 color changing characters and adding levels
